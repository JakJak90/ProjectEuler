# ProjectEuler
Repository to house coded solutions to Project Euler challenges

2020-09-27
In January 2019 I was looking for something to challenge me and some friends suggested I teach myself to code.
I started with C# to see if I would like it and completed the first 2 Project Euler questions to see if I could.
I have since improved upon my skills, and wil be continuing with Project Euler challenges as time permits.

Project Euler Q1
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Project Euler Q2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
                          1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
